The "Lethal Fall" mod for Rain World

# Building
I used Visual Studio 2022 to build this mod. Having the ".NET desktop development" workload will work fine. You don't need anything optional expect for ".NET Framework 4.8 development tools".

Then just create a new file called "Class1.cs" or if that file already exists, just copy code from this github repo and paste it there. Then you can build.
